                <h2>Beaver Meadow: More Than a Golf Course — A Year-Round Destination</h2>
                <p>Beaver Meadow is more than just a summer destination. With the right infrastructure — including a
                    functioning, modern clubhouse — it has the potential to become a four-season hub for recreation.
                    Plans for expanded outdoor winter activities like cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, and skating are
                    on the table. But we cannot truly begin to grow these offerings without investing in a year-round
                    facility that can serve as a home base for all users.</p>
                <p>Without a clubhouse, we’re not just limiting golfers — we’re turning away winter families, school
                    groups, and community events that would otherwise thrive here. And how can we call ourselves a
                    welcoming community if we alienate our neighbors?</p>

                <h2>Clearing Up the Misinformation</h2>
                <p>There’s a false narrative circulating that non-residents are unfairly subsidized at Beaver Meadow —
                    that they pay the same greens fees as Concord residents. That simply isn’t true. The rate structure
                    changed more than a year ago to reflect a fair and thoughtful balance between encouraging regional
                    participation and respecting Concord taxpayers. Non-resident rates were adjusted to ensure that all
                    who enjoy Beaver Meadow contribute accordingly.</p>
                <p>Beaver Meadow is owned by the people of Concord, but it serves a much wider audience. And that’s
                    something to be proud of — not something to gatekeep.</p>

                <h2>In Support of Our Shared Future</h2>
                <p>Supporting Beaver Meadow — and supporting public and community-oriented golf throughout central New
                    Hampshire — means investing in more than recreation. It means protecting spaces that bring people
                    together, support local economies, and help towns stay connected to both tradition and each other.
                </p>
                <p>Whether you're a regular on the tee sheet or someone who's never picked up a club, there's a place
                    for you at Beaver Meadow — and at every course in our region that puts community first. With the
                    right investment, we can turn Beaver Meadow into a year-round destination that serves everyone —
                    golfers, skiers, skaters, neighbors, and friends.</p>
                <p>Because building community means opening the doors, not closing them</p>
